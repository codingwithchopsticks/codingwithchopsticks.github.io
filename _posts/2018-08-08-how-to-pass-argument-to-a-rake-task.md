There are many ways how to pass an argument to a rake task, some of these are covered in at this [blog post](https://cobwwweb.com/4-ways-to-pass-arguments-to-a-rake-task).

IMHO, the most elegant way to do this is using the first way described at post, the [Rake Way](https://cobwwweb.com/4-ways-to-pass-arguments-to-a-rake-task#method-1-the-rake-way):

```ruby
  task :add, [:num1, :num2] do |_, args|
    puts args[:num1].to_i + args[:num2].to_i
  end
```

And, you run itâ€¦

```bash
  $ rake add[1,2]
  # => 3
```

All right! Nothing to do here! YAY!

A common task block is like this:

```ruby
  task some_task: :environment do
    # Do awesome things...
  end
```

The `:environment` symbol is what tells to rake task to [load your entire Rails environment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7044714/whats-the-environment-task-in-rake/18617481#18617481). So, without this you can't access your models, for example.

To using arguments in a elegant way and load your Rails environment in your Rake task, you can write your task method like this:

```ruby
  task :add, [:num1, :num2] => :environment do |_, args|
    puts args[:num1].to_i + args[:num2].to_i
  end
```

And, this is the output:

```shell
  $ rake add[1,2]
  # => 3
```
